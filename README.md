A dippy judge in Go.

For autogenerated documentation, see http://godoc.org/github.com/zond/godip.

### Policy

This is, currently, my thoughts on what must be true in all variants this judge shall support.

* There is a Map with Provinces.
 * Each Province can contain at most one Unit.
 * Each Province can contain at most one SupplyCenter.
* Each Province has one or more SubProvinces.
 * Each SubProvince has attributes, such as Sea, Land or Coast.
 * Each SubProvince has connections to other SubProvinces.
* There are Units with UnitType and Nationality.
 * Each unit is in one SubProvince.
* There are SupplyCenters with Nationality.
 * Each SupplyCenter is in one Province.
* There are Phases with Year, Season and PhaseType.
* Orders can vary greatly:
 * They can be valid only for certain Years, PhaseTypes or Seasons.
 * They can be valid only for certain UnitTypes.
 * They can be valid only for certain Map environments.
 * They can be valid only when certain other Orders are valid.
 * They can be valid only when certain Units are present.

### Todo

* Implement Convoy
* Implement Build
* Implement Disband
* Implement Retreat
* Make the Phase interface able to post process a State
* Build a DATC parser.
* Introduce the DATC test cases from http://mtn-host.prjek.net/viewmtn/droidippy/branch/changes/cx.ath.troja.jdip.droidippy
* Make the DATC cases pass...
* Create DATC compatible test cases from the (at least later) part of the Droidippy database.

### Algorithm

Heavily inspired by [The Math of Adjudication](http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2009M/Kruijswijk/DipMath_Chp1.htm) by Lucas Kruijswijk.

Resolve is [judge.State#Resolve](https://github.com/zond/godip/blob/master/judge/judge.go).

Adjudicate is defined in each order type.
