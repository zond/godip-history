godip
=====

A DATC compliant dippy judge in Go.

Tested against over 5000 real games played by humans.

For autogenerated documentation, see http://godoc.org/github.com/zond/godip.

To run the DATC test cases:

```
cd classical
go test
```

To run the tests against the real human played games:

```
cd classical/droidippy
go test
```

### Variant support

Currently only Standard diplomacy is supported.

Many variants would, however, be simple to implement in godip, or using godip.

These are the truths that should be valid for such a variant to be godip compatible in a simple manner:

* There is a Map with Provinces.
 * Each Province can contain at most one Unit.
 * Each Province can contain at most one SupplyCenter.
* Each Province has one or more SubProvinces.
 * Each SubProvince has attributes, such as Sea, Land or Coast.
 * Each SubProvince has connections to other SubProvinces.
* There are Units with UnitType and Nation.
 * Each unit is in one SubProvince.
* There are SupplyCenters with Nation.
 * Each SupplyCenter is in one Province.
* There are Phases with Year, Season and PhaseType.
* Orders can vary greatly:
 * They can be valid only for certain Years, PhaseTypes or Seasons.
 * They can be valid only for certain UnitTypes.
 * They can be valid only for certain Map environments.
 * They can be valid only when certain other Orders are valid.
 * They can be valid only when certain Units are present.

### Algorithm

Heavily inspired by [The Math of Adjudication](http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2009M/Kruijswijk/DipMath_Chp1.htm) by Lucas Kruijswijk.

Resolve is https://github.com/zond/godip/blob/master/state/resolver.go.

Adjudicate is defined in each order type.
